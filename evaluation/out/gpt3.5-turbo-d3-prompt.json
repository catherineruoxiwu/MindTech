It's completely understandable that it felt terrible to disclose your condition and ask for assistance, especially if you were used to being the one taking care of others.\n\nIt's important to recognize that it's okay to ask for help and support when you need it, regardless of the circumstances. None of us are immune to facing challenges or health issues, and relying on others doesn't diminish your worth or the caring role you've played in the past. Leukemia is a serious illness, and it's understandable that it has impacted your relationships and family dynamics. It's important to give yourself permission to feel and process the grief and loss associated with these changes.\n\nIn light of the realization that you're just an ordinary person with problems like everyone else, it might be helpful to explore self-compassion. Self-compassion involves treating yourself with kindness, understanding, and care, just as you would treat a loved one going through a difficult time. This can include acknowledging your own pain and suffering, and recognizing that it is valid and deserving of compassion.\n\nHave you practiced self-compassion or explored any strategies to help yourself cope with these challenges?"

I'm not sure whether my ADHD symptoms were there in my early years, as my mom might not be the best source of information about that.",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling like a big mess due to your ADHD diagnosis. It can be challenging when you don't have clear information about your childhood symptoms. In such cases, it can be helpful to explore other sources to gain insight into your early experiences. One possible approach could be to reach out to other family members, such as grandparents or close relatives who may have spent time with you during your childhood. They might have a different perspective and may be able to recall certain behaviors or patterns that could be linked to ADHD.\n\nAdditionally, it could be beneficial to consider reaching out to your school or educational institutions you attended during your early years. They may have records of your academic performance, behavior, or any referrals made for assessment purposes. These records can provide valuable information and insight into any difficulties or challenges you may have experienced.\n\nUnderstanding your childhood symptoms can help in developing a comprehensive understanding of your ADHD and how it has affected you over time.

    "question": "Nowadays, it is often said that the emotional stability of parents has a profound impact on a family and on a child. Unfortunately and unfortunately, I was faced with parents whose emotional characteristics were: stubborn, controlling, resentful, irritable, and self-absorbed (they both complained and blamed each other, but these characteristics were particularly evident in both of them). Both of them were irritable, but they demanded that I had to accept their behavioral arrangements without thinking about whether it was reasonable for them to do so and whether it affected my normal study and work. (In particular, my parents were trying to control me with all kinds of brutal interventions after I became an adult in high school.) No matter how hard I tried to reason with both of them, it was all in vain. They brought me endless negative emotions. All I can do is running away from them, and I even feel like I have an aversion to the words they say, their perceptions, their behavior, and the stupidity they reveal. I feel that I have run out of words and I have lost patience to communicate with them. I have lost patience to communicate with them, because no matter how to reason with them, including arguing, they will not reflect.",
    "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're facing with your parents. Dealing with parents who exhibit challenging emotional characteristics can indeed be very tough and can take a toll on your own emotional well-being. It sounds like their stubbornness, control, resentment, irritability, and self-absorption are creating a toxic environment for you, and it's understandable that you feel overwhelmed and frustrated.\n\nIt's important to prioritize your own mental health and find ways to cope with this situation. Have you considered seeking support from other individuals in your life, such as friends, family members, or other trusted adults? Having a strong support system can provide you with emotional validation and help you feel less alone in dealing with this challenging dynamic.\n\nIn addition, it might be helpful for you to find healthy outlets and coping mechanisms to manage the negative emotions you're experiencing. Engaging in activities that bring you joy, practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation, and expressing yourself through journaling or art can be effective ways to process your emotions and reduce stress.\n\nI'm also curious about how this situation is affecting your overall social function. Do you feel comfortable sharing any changes you may have noticed in your relationships with friends, family, or peers due to the stress caused by your parents' behaviors?"

    "question": "I am a self-tested as a BPD patient and hope to stabilize my emotions through medication. What should I do?",
    "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I can offer you some general information and suggestions. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) can be challenging to manage, and it often requires a comprehensive treatment approach. Medication can be useful in treating some symptoms associated with BPD, such as depression, anxiety, or mood swings. However, it's important to note that medication alone is not typically enough to fully address BPD.\n\nI would recommend seeking professional help from a mental health provider who can assess your symptoms and provide an accurate diagnosis. They can also evaluate whether medication is appropriate for you and discuss potential options. In addition to medication, therapy, such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), is considered a highly effective treatment for BPD. This therapy focuses on improving emotional regulation, interpersonal skills, and self-awareness.\n\nIt's essential to maintain open communication with your mental health provider, as they can guide you through the process and monitor the effectiveness of any prescribed medication. It's also important to have a support system in place, such as friends, family, or support groups, who can offer understanding and encouragement throughout your journey.\n\nDo you have any specific concerns or questions regarding medication or other aspects of managing BPD?"

It could be beneficial to have an open and non-judgmental conversation about her experiences and how she perceives her own abilities.\n\nCan you share more about her emotional state?

    "answer": "It sounds like your counselor is trying to help you work on your anger and aggression issues by testing your ability to stay calm in trigger situations. However, it's important to ensure that this testing process doesn't put you or your counselor in any physical or emotional danger.\n\nHave you discussed with your counselor the specific situations in which you tend to become angry and aggressive? It could be beneficial to openly communicate with your counselor about the triggers you experience and any concerns you have about the testing process.

Additionally, during your counseling sessions, have you and your counselor explored the underlying causes of your anger and aggression? Understanding the root causes can be essential in developing effective coping strategies and finding long-term solutions.\n\nPlease remember that if at any point during the testing process you feel overwhelmed or unsafe, it is important to communicate this to your counselor immediately.

I personally tend to be more relaxed when alone, and will not often share my own things to others, and I am not actually interested in other people's things. But every time a friend share with me, I will be polite to ask themselves and reply seriously even if I am not interested or even if it is very annoying, so that I feel very tired. At the same time it also strengthen the desire of my friends to share with me. Now basically every day from the moment I get a lot of messages, most of the time down the day I am returning messages, many of my plans are disrupted and particularly tired, what should I do?",
    "answer": "It sounds like you've been experiencing exhaustion and feeling overwhelmed by the constant sharing and communication from your friends. It's important to acknowledge and respect your own boundaries and personal preferences when it comes to social interactions.\n\nTo begin with, it might be helpful to reflect on why you feel the need to respond to every message and share even when you're not interested. Are there underlying fears or pressures that drive you to behave in this way? Understanding these motivations can help you develop healthier boundaries.\n\nOne suggestion could be to have an open and honest conversation with your friends about your need for personal space and alone time. Let them know that while you value their friendship, you also need some time for yourself. It may be helpful to express your feelings of exhaustion and how it is affecting your overall well-being. You can ask for their understanding and support in respecting your boundaries.\n\nIn addition, it could be beneficial to set specific times during the day to respond to messages and engage in social interactions.

    "answer": "It's understandable that you might feel frustrated when your friend complains about being tired after working 40 hours a week, especially considering your own responsibilities of going to school, work, and taking care of your kids. It's natural for us to compare our experiences with others and sometimes feel that our own efforts are not being recognized.\n\nHowever, it's important to keep in mind that everyone experiences and perceives the world differently.

I reply to people no matter how busy I am. Sometimes, for example, at night, I just keep waiting and sleep. What should I do?",
    "answer": "It sounds like you are experiencing a sense of uncertainty and anxiety when others don't respond to you in chats. This can be quite distressing and can result in you constantly checking the chat and waiting for replies. It's great that you make an effort to respond to others promptly, but it's also important to remember that people have different priorities and schedules, which may delay their responses.\n\nTo address this, it might be helpful to explore a few strategies:\n\n1. Acknowledge and challenge your thoughts: When you find yourself waiting anxiously for a response, try to identify any negative or unhelpful thoughts that may be fueling your anxiety. Challenge these thoughts by questioning their accuracy or considering alternative explanations. Remind yourself that people have their own reasons for delayed responses, and it's not necessarily a reflection of your worth or importance.\n\n2. Develop self-soothing techniques: Anxiety can be managed through relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, mindfulness, or engaging in activities that bring you joy or relaxation. When you find yourself excessively checking the chat, redirect your attention to these techniques to help calm your mind.\n\n3. Engage in other activities: Instead of solely focusing on waiting for replies, try to get involved in other activities that you enjoy or find meaningful. This can help distract your mind and reduce the intensity of your anxious thoughts. Consider pursuing hobbies, spending time with loved ones, or participating in activities that promote self-care.\n\n4. Communicate your feelings: If this pattern of waiting and feeling anxious persists, it might be worth discussing your concerns with the individuals involved. Openly sharing your feelings in a gentle and non-confrontational manner can help promote understanding and potentially alleviate some of your worries.\n\nRemember, it's important to prioritize your mental well-being. If you find that your anxiety continues to impact your daily life or causes significant distress, seeking support from a mental health professional can be beneficial. They can provide personalized strategies to address your specific concerns. How long have you been experiencing these feelings of anxiety when waiting for chat responses?"

It's natural to want grandparents to play an active role in their grandchildren's lives, and it's understandable that you may have certain expectations in terms of visits and involvement.\n\nFirst, it's important to recognize that everyone has different ways of showing love and care. While your mom may not be physically present as often as you would like, it seems like she is making efforts to stay connected through gifts and regular phone calls. These actions suggest that she does care about her grandchildren and wants to have a relationship with them.\n\nHowever, it's also valid to have concerns about the level of involvement. Have you communicated your feelings and expectations to your mom? Open and honest communication can be helpful in understanding each other's perspectives and finding common ground. It might be worth having a conversation with her, expressing your thoughts and feelings, and asking her how she envisions her involvement in your children's lives.\n\nAdditionally, consider exploring alternative ways for your mom to be involved even if she is not able to visit as often as you would like. For example, she could connect with your children through virtual platforms like video calls or sending recorded messages. This way, your children can still maintain a connection with their grandmother, even from a distance.\n\nIt may also be helpful for you to reflect on the underlying reasons for your anxiety. Are there any specific concerns or fears that are contributing to these feelings? Exploring the root causes of your anxiety can help you gain clarity and develop strategies to address them effectively.\n\nOverall, it's important to keep in mind that every family's dynamics and circumstances are unique.

She was left with severe separation anxiety from her childhood, resulting in severe clinginess, lack of confidence, and needing me to keep tabs on her status. She even asks to share a bed with me and touch each other's bodies when we are both same-sex adults and have no homosexual tendencies. Personally, I am avoidant, so I felt stifled and uncomfortable. But whenever I objected to this, she would be extremely sad and unable to communicate. And this definitely gave her a second injury. I feel guilty, but I still don't think I should feel free to ignore my feelings. Now I am in complete conflict with her basic demands - she needs my attention and I want to have enough personal space.

Offer empathy: Try to understand the root causes of her behavior, such as her childhood separation anxiety. Show empathy and let her know that you want to support her in finding healthier ways to cope with her anxieties and fears.\n\n4. Suggest seeking professional help: Recommend that she consider seeking therapy or counseling to address her separation anxiety. A mental health professional can provide her with the tools and support needed to work through her challenges in a healthy way.\n\n5. Establish boundaries together: Work with her to establish clear and mutually agreed-upon boundaries that respect both of your needs. This could include setting limits on physical touch, personal space, and communication.\n\n6. Encourage self-reflection and personal growth: Help your friend explore activities or hobbies that promote self-esteem and encourage independence. Encourage her to develop her own sense of identity and self-reliance.\n\nRemember, in some cases, despite your best efforts, it may not be possible to resolve the conflict completely.

    "question": "Why do people get schizophrenia? What are the manifestations, can it be treated with counseling and how far can one recover? How long does it take and will doctors misdiagnose it when I go to the hospital. Thanks...",
    "answer": "Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that can be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurological factors. It is believed that a combination of genetic predisposition, certain brain structure abnormalities, chemical imbalances, and environmental triggers may contribute to the development of schizophrenia. However, the exact cause of schizophrenia is still not fully understood.\n\nThe manifestations of schizophrenia can vary from person to person but commonly include hallucinations (perceiving things that aren't there), delusions (holding false beliefs), disorganized thinking and speech, social withdrawal, reduced emotional expression, and difficulties with concentration and memory. It is important to note that not everyone with schizophrenia will experience all of these symptoms.\n\nCounseling, along with other forms of treatment, can be beneficial for individuals with schizophrenia. Counseling, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or family therapy, can help individuals develop coping strategies, improve communication skills, manage their symptoms, and enhance their functional abilities. Counseling can also provide emotional support, reduce distress, and help individuals and their families understand and navigate through the challenges associated with schizophrenia.\n\nRecovery from schizophrenia is possible, but it can vary from person to person. With appropriate treatment, including medication, counseling, and support services, many individuals with schizophrenia are able to manage their symptoms effectively and lead fulfilling lives. It is important to set realistic expectations as recovery may involve ongoing management of symptoms and support throughout the person's lifetime.\n\nThe duration of recovery can vary depending on several factors, including the severity of symptoms, the individual's response to treatment, their support system, and access to resources. It is crucial to work closely with healthcare professionals to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses the individual's specific needs.\n\nRegarding misdiagnosis, it is possible for any medical condition to be misdiagnosed, including schizophrenia. However, with advances in diagnostic tools and criteria, accurate diagnosis has improved significantly. To minimize the likelihood of misdiagnosis, healthcare professionals use standardized assessment tools, gather thorough medical history, and consider input from both the individual and their family. It is important to provide detailed and accurate information about your symptoms to your healthcare provider, which can help in making an accurate diagnosis.\n\nIf you have concerns about your mental health, I encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional for an evaluation. They can provide an accurate diagnosis, discuss treatment options, and address any questions or concerns you may have."

    "question": "How can I tell if I really trust my counselor? I have been working with this counselor for over a year. Recently, I suspect that I may not trust her enough because of certain factors, including her training, appearance, etc., and I did not get a positive response from her after I had the courage to bring it up to her. At one point I suspected that she was not handling her self-exposure well and didn't dare to bring it up to her directly for fear that she would be sad. I would like to ask how to determine if I trust my counselor enough and if there are some basic guidelines? And how do I handle it and do I need to consider changing counselors? Thank you!",

Let me provide you some guidelines to help you determine if you trust your counselor and how to handle it.\n\n1. Reflect on your feelings: Take some time to reflect on your emotional response to your counselor. Do you feel comfortable, safe, and understood during sessions? Trust is often based on your emotional connection with your counselor, so pay attention to how you feel during sessions.\n\n2. Evaluate communication: Consider how openly and honestly you can communicate with your counselor. Trust is built on a foundation of honest and effective communication. Are you able to express your concerns and have open discussions about topics that matter to you? Assess the quality of your interactions.\n\n3. Assess transparency and boundaries: Trust can be influenced by your counselor's transparency and ability to maintain appropriate professional boundaries. Reflect on your perceptions of your counselor's self-exposure. Are you comfortable with the level of disclosure and boundaries established? It's essential for counselors to maintain professionalism while still creating a genuine therapeutic relationship.\n\n4. Explore your expectations: Think about what you expect from your counselor. Each person may have different expectations, and it's crucial for you to determine whether your counselor meets them. Consider whether your counselor's training and expertise align with your goals for therapy.\n\nRegarding your concerns about discussing your doubts with your counselor, it is vital to have open and honest communication in therapy. Professional counselors recognize the importance of addressing trust issues and will appreciate your candor.\n\nTo handle the situation, you may consider discussing your concerns with your counselor. Share your feelings and thoughts in a calm and non-accusatory manner, expressing your desire to work towards building trust. Pay attention to your counselor's response and willingness to address your concerns. A positive response, with an effort to understand and resolve the issue, can indicate a commitment to your therapeutic relationship.\n\nIf, after discussing your concerns, you still find it challenging to trust your counselor, it may be beneficial to explore alternative options. Finding a counselor who better aligns with your needs and expectations can be a valuable step in your therapy journey.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to change counselors is yours to make. Trust and a positive therapeutic relationship are vital for progress in therapy, so it's important to choose a counselor you feel comfortable and confident with.\n\nRemember, as a client, you have the right to seek a counselor who meets your needs. Trust your instincts and prioritize your well-being throughout this process. If you need further guidance in making this decision, discussing it with a trusted friend or seeking a second opinion from another mental health professional could also be helpful."

    "question": "How should I comfort my parents when my grandmother passed away? I don't have much communication with my parents. Two days ago, my father informed me on WeChat that my grandmother passed away due to illness and asked me to go back next week to attend the funeral, but not much else was said. My first thought was that my mother must be very sad, but I didn't think to call first to comfort or something like that. It's been three days now, and there's been no communication between my parents and I. I don't know what to do, whether I need to care, and how to care.",

Sending you love and strength during this challenging time.\"\n\nIt's also important to recognize that grief can be a complex process, and individuals may need varying amounts of time to process their emotions.
