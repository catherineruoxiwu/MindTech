I think I'm a hard worker and feel frustrated when she complains about being tired after working 40 hours a week, especially considering I go to school, work, and have two kids.",
    "answer": "It sounds like you have a deep connection with your friend and value the time you spend together. It's natural for differences to arise in any relationship, and it's important to acknowledge and address these feelings of frustration.\n\nWhen your friend complains about being tired after working 40 hours a week, it's understandable that you may feel frustrated, especially considering your own busy schedule. It can be challenging when we perceive someone else's struggles as less significant than our own.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that everyone's experiences and capacities are unique. People may have different levels of stamina, coping mechanisms, and responsibilities that affect their ability to handle certain situations. Comparing your friend's exhaustion to your own may not be productive in fostering a supportive and understanding relationship.\n\nInstead of dwelling on these frustrations, try to shift your perspective and focus on offering empathy and support. You could start by actively listening to your friend and asking open-ended questions about her experiences and feelings. Understanding her perspective might help you gain a better insight into her challenges and allow you to offer more meaningful support.\n\nAdditionally, it's crucial to communicate your own experiences and feelings in a compassionate and non-confrontational manner. Find a calm moment to express how you handle your own workload and responsibilities, and explain how it may differ from her situation. This can help foster understanding and bridge any gaps in perception.\n\nRemember, friendship is about supporting each other through both good times and challenging moments. By fostering open and empathetic communication, you can strengthen your bond and find ways to support each other better."

    "question": "I feel like I'm getting a little better at challenging my thoughts without the worksheet, but I struggle when it comes to understanding others' reasons for their actions. Like, if my friend couldn't attend my event due to prior obligations or work, I'd understand. But if she didn't want to, I'd be very hurt and I don't know if I can get over it.",
    "answer": "It's great to hear that you're making progress in challenging your thoughts! Understanding others' reasons for their actions can indeed be a challenging aspect of interpersonal relationships. It's natural to feel hurt when someone doesn't want to attend an event or do something you've invited them to, especially if you were looking forward to their presence.\n\nIt's important to remember that everyone has their own preferences, priorities, and limitations. While it may be difficult to accept initially, it's essential to acknowledge that we can't control others' decisions or feelings. It's also essential to separate their choices from our self-worth. Just because someone chooses not to attend an event doesn't mean they value us any less as a person or a friend.\n\nIt may be helpful to explore your feelings of hurt further. Is there a specific reason why your friend's non-attendance would affect you so deeply? Are there any underlying insecurities or fears that contribute to this reaction? Understanding these emotions can help you gain insight into your own needs and expectations in relationships.\n\nAdditionally, open and honest communication with your friend can be beneficial. Expressing how you felt and discussing your emotions in a non-confrontational manner allows both parties to better understand each other's perspectives. Remember, it's okay to feel hurt, but it's also essential to approach the conversation with an open mind and a willingness to listen to their side of the story.\n\nLastly, practicing self-compassion is crucial throughout this process. Be kind to yourself and remind yourself that it's normal to have emotional reactions. Accept that you feel hurt, and allow yourself the space and time to heal. Ultimately, focusing on nurturing your own emotional well-being will allow you to navigate future situations with more resilience and understanding."

It's great that you have taken steps to clean up your own act, and now you find yourself facing this challenge.\n\nFirst off, it's important to remember that you cannot control your partner's actions or choices. You can, however, express your concerns and provide support. Have you talked to your partner about how their drug use makes you feel and the potential consequences it could have on your lives?\n\nBuilding open and honest communication is crucial in any relationship, especially when tackling sensitive issues like substance abuse. It's important that your partner feels heard and understood, but also aware of how their actions are affecting you and your shared goals.\n\nExpressing your concerns could be a first step. You could say something like, \"I've noticed that you're still using drugs, and it worries me because I don't want us to go back to the issues we had before. Can we talk about this and find a way to support each other in staying clean and avoiding potential problems with the Department?\"\n\nBy initiating this conversation, you're giving your partner an opportunity to share their reasons and perspective. It's important to approach this discussion with empathy and without judgment. Ask open-ended questions like, \"How are you feeling about your drug use?\" or \"What do you see as the potential consequences of continuing drug use?\" This can encourage reflection and dialogue.\n\nDepending on your partner's responses, you can explore options together. You might suggest seeking professional help, such as addiction counseling or therapy, both individually and as a couple. Additionally, connecting with support groups or community resources can also be beneficial.\n\nRemember, change takes time, and relapses can happen.

It's natural to worry about the well-being of your loved ones, especially when it comes to genetic conditions.\n\nFirstly, it's important to remember that having a genetic predisposition to a certain condition does not guarantee that your children will definitely develop it. Genetic testing provides valuable information about potential risks, but it doesn't provide all the answers. There are many other factors that contribute to the manifestation of genetic conditions, including environmental factors and lifestyle choices.\n\nIt might be helpful for you to discuss this matter with a medical professional who specializes in genetics, such as a genetic counselor or a pediatrician. They can provide you with more specific information about the likelihood of your children developing the condition and any preventive measures that can be taken.\n\nIn the meantime, it can also be beneficial to focus on promoting a healthy lifestyle for your children. This can include regular exercise, a balanced diet, and taking steps to manage stress. While these lifestyle factors may not directly impact the specific genetic condition in question, they can contribute to overall health and well-being, and potentially mitigate other risk factors.\n\nRemember, it's completely normal to have concerns and fears about your children's health. Seeking support from professionals and connecting with others who may have similar experiences can provide additional reassurance and guidance."

    "question": "I think resistance doesn't exist. But in the tradition of solution-focused therapy, we believe that each client has their own unique way of cooperating, and resisting is one of them. Maybe scaling would be nice for him, in that scaling sometimes allows a person to feel less overwhelmed. Well, here's my idea, and it's not going to be of much use unless you put it through the filter of your own knowledge and your own style: I would make a scale and, at one end is he's seeing friends, it's cleaned to a degree that he's happy, and whatever else he thought was important, we would put that at the 10.",
    "answer": "It's interesting that you bring up the concept of resistance and the solution-focused therapy approach. In solution-focused therapy, we do acknowledge that clients have their own unique ways of cooperating, and resistance can be one of them. It sounds like you're considering using scaling as a technique to help your client feel less overwhelmed. \n\nCreating a scale can be a helpful tool to assess progress and identify what is important to your client. It can also provide a visual representation of where they currently are and where they would like to be. By placing \"seeing friends\" and having a clean space at the 10 on the scale, you are setting specific goals that your client can work towards.\n\nI encourage you to involve your client in the process and have a collaborative conversation about what they value and what is important to them. Ask open-ended questions to explore their thoughts and feelings about these goals. For example, you could ask, \"How would you feel if you were able to see your friends and have a cleaned space? What impact would that have on your overall well-being?\"\n\nRemember that each client is unique, and it's important to tailor your approach to their specific needs, preferences, and circumstances. Keep an open mind and be flexible in your approach, and always work together with your client to co-create solutions that align with their goals and values."

    "answer": "I can understand how challenging it must be to juggle the responsibilities of being a mother and feeling the weight of your husband's situation. It's common for parents to experience feelings of guilt and self-blame in difficult situations. It's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling this way, and it's natural to question yourself in challenging circumstances.\n\nMoving past these feelings of guilt and self-blame can be a gradual process, but it is definitely possible. One step is to recognize that you are doing the best you can with the resources and knowledge you have at any given moment. It's important to acknowledge that you cannot control everything and that there are factors beyond your control.\n\nIt might also be helpful to explore self-compassion and practicing kindness towards yourself. Instead of beating yourself up for perceived shortcomings, try to treat yourself with the same understanding and empathy you would extend to a close friend. Recognize that you are human and that making mistakes is a part of life.\n\nIt could be beneficial to seek support from friends, family, or even a therapist who can provide a non-judgmental space for you to express and process your feelings. Sometimes, gaining a different perspective can help alleviate guilt and reframe situations in a more positive light.\n\nRemember, you are doing the best you can, and it's important to be kind to yourself throughout this journey.

I've considered terminating our relationship if he doesn't improve.",
    "answer": "It sounds like you're facing a challenging situation with your client. It can be frustrating when our usual approaches don't seem to work. Instead of resorting to threats or considering termination, let's explore some alternative strategies that might be helpful.\n\nFirst, it's important to remember that therapy is a collaborative process. Have you had an open and honest discussion with your client about their response to your suggestions? It could be helpful to explore their perspective and understand why they may not be responding well. This will also allow you to adjust your approach accordingly.\n\nSometimes, clients may not respond to our suggestions because they feel misunderstood or unsupported. It might be helpful to validate their feelings and provide a safe space for them to express their concerns. Showing empathy and understanding can go a long way in building trust and facilitating change.\n\nAdditionally, it could be beneficial to reassess your therapeutic goals and approach. Are you focusing on their unique needs and strengths? Are there alternative interventions or techniques that could be more effective? Collaborating with your client to develop a new plan that aligns with their specific challenges and preferences could lead to better outcomes.\n\nLastly, if you feel that your client would benefit from a different therapeutic approach or additional support, you could explore the possibility of referring them to a colleague or specialist who may have a different skill set or perspective.\n\nRemember, every client is unique, and sometimes it takes time to find the right approach. By fostering open communication, empathy, and flexibility, you can create a space for growth and improvement in your therapeutic relationship."

    "answer": "It sounds like you have concerns about your daughter's perspective on things and you want her to accept reality in a certain way. It's normal for parents to have expectations for their children, but it's important to remember that everyone experiences and copes with situations differently. It might be helpful to explore why you feel that her perspective must align with your own. Are there specific reasons or fears that are contributing to this belief?\n\nIt's also important to consider that putting pressure on your daughter to conform to your expectations could potentially create additional stress and anxiety for both of you. Instead, it might be more beneficial to focus on supporting her in her own journey of coping and understanding her situation. This could involve actively listening to her perspective, empathizing with her feelings, and offering support in a non-judgmental way.\n\nIt can be challenging to let go of our own expectations, but by allowing your daughter the space to process and navigate her own reality, you might find that she develops her own coping mechanisms and finds her own ways of acceptance.

These connections to literature, newspapers, and articles related to my gender change are both a curse and a comfort.",
    "answer": "It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, and I appreciate you reaching out to talk about it. Dealing with a double bind can be really difficult, but it's great that you're taking steps to cope with it. \n\nIt's understandable that you may feel afraid of throwing away something that you might want to read or connect with later. These connections to literature, newspapers, and articles related to your gender change can hold a lot of meaning and comfort for you. It's important to acknowledge and honor that.\n\nOne approach you could consider is creating a system to organize your materials. This way, you'll have a better idea of what you have and what you might want to keep for future reference. You could create different categories or folders to sort your literature, newspapers, and articles related to your gender change. This might give you a sense of control over your belongings and reduce the anxiety of accidentally throwing away something important.\n\nAdditionally, you can set aside some time to go through your collection periodically. This will allow you to assess what is still meaningful to you and what you no longer need. By doing this regularly, you can continue to declutter while also ensuring that you don't discard something you'll regret later.\n\nRemember, going through this process can be a gradual one. You can take your time and pace yourself according to what feels comfortable for you. And if you find it challenging to make decisions about what to keep or let go of, it might be helpful to explore these feelings further with a therapist who can guide you through the process.\n\nIt's important to strike a balance between decluttering for your well-being and keeping the connections that bring comfort and support to your gender change journey.

    "question": "Nowadays, it is often said that the emotional stability of parents has a profound impact on a family and on a child. Unfortunately and unfortunately, I was faced with parents whose emotional characteristics were: stubborn, controlling, resentful, irritable, and self-absorbed (they both complained and blamed each other, but these characteristics were particularly evident in both of them). Both of them were irritable, but they demanded that I had to accept their behavioral arrangements without thinking about whether it was reasonable for them to do so and whether it affected my normal study and work. (In particular, my parents were trying to control me with all kinds of brutal interventions after I became an adult in high school.) No matter how hard I tried to reason with both of them, it was all in vain. They brought me endless negative emotions. All I can do is running away from them, and I even feel like I have an aversion to the words they say, their perceptions, their behavior, and the stupidity they reveal. I feel that I have run out of words and I have lost patience to communicate with them. I have lost patience to communicate with them, because no matter how to reason with them, including arguing, they will not reflect.",

It sounds like their behavior and demands have had a negative impact on your well-being and made it difficult for you to have a healthy and constructive relationship with them.\n\nIt's important to remember that you cannot control or change your parents' behavior, but you can try to manage your own reactions and find ways to cope with the situation.

Boundaries can help protect your own mental health and establish a clear line between what you are willing to accept and what is not acceptable to you. It's important to communicate your boundaries calmly and assertively, expressing your needs and expectations.\n\nAdditionally, seeking support from others can also be helpful. You may want to consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or even a therapist who can provide you with guidance and assist you in processing your emotions in a healthy way. They can offer you a different perspective and suggest coping strategies that might be effective for your specific situation.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be treated with respect and understanding. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and take steps to protect yourself from their negative behaviors, even if it means limiting your contact with them or seeking distance."

    "question": "Why do people get schizophrenia? What are the manifestations, can it be treated with counseling and how far can one recover? How long does it take and will doctors misdiagnose it when I go to the hospital. Thanks...",
    "answer": "Schizophrenia is a complex mental health disorder, and the exact cause is not yet fully understood. It is believed to be a result of a combination of genetic, environmental, and chemical factors. The manifestations of schizophrenia can vary from person to person, but common symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and a decline in social functioning.\n\nCounseling can play an important role in the treatment of schizophrenia, but it is usually just one part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Medications, such as antipsychotic drugs, are often prescribed to manage symptoms. Additionally, psychosocial interventions, family support, and lifestyle changes can contribute to a person's recovery.\n\nThe recovery process for schizophrenia varies from individual to individual. While some people may experience significant improvement and regain their functioning abilities, others may have a more challenging journey. It's important to remember that recovery is a unique and ongoing process.\n\nWhen it comes to diagnosis, it is possible for doctors to misdiagnose schizophrenia, especially as there are other conditions with overlapping symptoms. However, doctors use specific criteria and guidelines to make an accurate diagnosis, considering the individual's symptoms, medical history, and other relevant factors. If you have concerns about a potential misdiagnosis, it can be helpful to seek a second opinion from another qualified professional.\n\nI hope this information helps.

Is there something specific that tends to set off the attacks? Are there any stressors or unresolved emotional issues that might be contributing to your anxiety?

    "answer": "It sounds like you had good intentions in wanting to share the warm and healing books with your friend to make her happy. It can be frustrating when our gestures of kindness are not received as we expected. It's important to understand that everyone has their own perspective and reactions to things, and sometimes they may not align with our intentions.\n\nIt's possible that your friend may have had different expectations or concerns regarding the gift. Sometimes, misunderstandings can happen, and it's important to openly communicate and clarify any misunderstandings or miscommunications. It's possible that she may not have expressed her concerns or preferences clearly, which led to the situation turning out differently than you both anticipated.\n\nIn terms of her reaction, it's important to remember that each person has their own way of expressing emotions.

This problem has been bothering me for a long time, I don't know how to solve it, I want to ask for a help",
    "answer": "I understand that you're struggling with feeling anxious and preoccupied after interacting with strangers, both online and in real life. It seems like you tend to overthink and dwell on these interactions, even when the other person has moved on and doesn't seem to care anymore. It can be difficult and overwhelming to constantly have these thoughts and doubts, which may make you hesitant to interact with others. \n\nFirstly, I want to reassure you that you're not alone in experiencing these feelings. Many people deal with social anxiety and find themselves getting caught up in thoughts and worries about how they are perceived by others. It's important to remember that these thoughts are often exaggerated and not an accurate reflection of reality. People generally don't pay as much attention to our moments of insecurity as we think they do, and they are busy dealing with their own worries and concerns.\n\nTo help address this issue, it might be helpful to explore some strategies:\n\n1. Challenge your thoughts: When negative thoughts start to consume you, try to challenge them with more realistic and positive ones. Remind yourself that you can't read other people's minds and that you're often imagining the worst case scenario. Ask yourself if the evidence truly supports your negative thoughts or if they are just assumptions.\n\n2. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and understanding to yourself. Remember that everyone makes mistakes and has moments of awkwardness. It's important to be patient and gentle with yourself when you feel you've said or done something wrong. Treat yourself with the same kindness and forgiveness that you would offer to a friend.\n\n3. Focus on the present: Instead of ruminating over past interactions, try to focus on the present moment. Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you stay grounded. Practice mindfulness or meditation techniques to help you stay present and reduce your anxiety.\n\n4. Gradual exposure: Gradually expose yourself to social situations that make you anxious. Start with smaller and less intimidating interactions and gradually work your way up. By doing this, you give yourself the opportunity to build confidence and realize that the outcomes are often much better than you anticipate.\n\n5. Seek professional help if needed: If these strategies don't seem to make a difference or if your anxiety becomes overwhelming, seeking guidance from a mental health professional can be beneficial. They can provide you with personalized strategies and support to help you overcome your anxiety.\n\nRemember, overcoming anxiety takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and give yourself credit for your progress, no matter how small. With practice and persistence, you can learn to manage your anxiety and feel more at ease when interacting with others."

It's understandable that you may not know how to comfort your parents, especially if you don't have much communication with them. Here are a few suggestions on how you can reach out and offer support:\n\n1. Start by expressing your condolences: You can send a message or call your parents to express your sympathy for their loss. Let them know that you are thinking of them during this tough time. You could say something like, \"I'm so sorry to hear about Grandma's passing. My thoughts are with both of you, and I'm here for you if you need anything.\"\n\n2. Show empathy and be a good listener: Be there for your parents if they want to talk about their feelings or share memories of your grandmother. Give them the space to express their emotions and actively listen without judgment. You can ask open-ended questions like, \"How are you feeling about Grandma's passing?\" or \"Can you tell me a favorite memory you have of her?\" This can help create an open dialogue and let them know you're there to listen.\n\n3. Offer practical support: If you're able to, ask your parents if there's anything you can do to help with the funeral arrangements or any other tasks that need to be taken care of. This could include making phone calls, organizing paperwork, or even just being there physically for support. Let them know you're willing to assist in any way that's helpful to them.\n\n4. Be patient and understanding: Grief affects everyone differently, and your parents may need time to process their emotions. They may not be reaching out to you right away, and that's okay. Show understanding and don't take it personally. Instead, let them know that you're available whenever they feel ready to talk or if they need someone to lean on.\n\nRemember, everyone copes with loss in their own way, and it's important to be gentle with yourself as well during this time.

It's important to remember that healing is a process, and it may take time to fully let go of these emotions. However, there are some steps we can take together to help you move towards a place of peace and acceptance.\n\nFirstly, it might be helpful to express your feelings in a safe and non-judgmental space. Consider finding someone you trust, whether it's a friend, family member, or therapist, with whom you can open up and discuss your experiences. Talking about your emotions can bring relief and provide an opportunity for validation and understanding.\n\nAdditionally, practicing self-care is crucial in times of emotional distress. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as hobbies, exercise, or spending time in nature, can help to alleviate stress and promote a sense of well-being. Taking care of your physical health through regular exercise, nutritious eating, and adequate sleep can also contribute to your overall emotional well-being.\n\nIn terms of addressing the bitterness and being reminded of your race, it may be helpful to challenge any negative thoughts and beliefs you may be holding onto. Recognize that the judgments and mistreatment you've experienced do not define your worth as a person. Surround yourself with supportive and inclusive individuals who appreciate you for who you are, rather than focusing on those who bring you down.\n\nLastly, consider seeking professional therapy to process your emotions and develop healthy coping strategies. A therapist can provide guidance and support as you work through your feelings of hurt and bitterness. They can also help you develop strategies for building resilience, enhancing self-esteem, and fostering a positive mindset.\n\nRemember, healing is a personal journey, and it's important to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you navigate through these difficult emotions.

Perhaps you can propose a trial period where you can demonstrate your ability to manage your own affairs and show her that you are capable of living independently.\n\nIt's important to approach the conversation with patience and understanding. Remember that change can be challenging for everyone involved, and it might take time for your mother to fully support your decision. In the end, building trust and maintaining open communication will help in navigating this situation together."

    "question": "After a counseling session at school, the counselor agreed with me to come back sometime this week, but I misremembered the time and was 20 minutes late, and by the time I got there the counselor had already left. Then there was always a very uncomfortable feeling that I had stood someone up, but there was no way to explain it to her because she didn't have counseling time later, and it felt hard, and it always made me feel like I was a bad person, and I felt that the counselor must have been angry with me, and I originally wanted to talk to her about this kind of similar problems, about my own mistakes that led to low self-esteem and self-criticism I had wanted to talk to her about the same kind of problems, such as low self-esteem and self-criticism due to mistakes I had made, as well as fear of relationships and social disorders, excessive concern for other people's opinions, and the feeling that people must hate me. But it's impossible to talk to her again, and I feel sorry and regretful that I have to re-establish trust and understanding again if I book another consultation. And I feel like I make mistakes all the time, and this feeling also makes me suffer.",
    "answer": "I'm really sorry to hear that you had this experience with the counseling session at school. It sounds like misremembering the time and being late was a difficult situation for you, and it's understandable that you would feel uncomfortable and like you stood someone up. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it doesn't make you a bad person.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you weren't able to explain the situation to the counselor because there was no counseling time later. It's natural to feel regretful and sorry about what happened, especially when you were hoping to discuss some important issues like low self-esteem, self-criticism, fear of relationships, social disorders, and concerns about other people's opinions.\n\nWhile it might be challenging to re-establish trust and understanding if you book another consultation, it's worth considering doing so. Counseling can be a valuable tool for working through these feelings and exploring ways to cope with them. Additionally, counselors are trained professionals who understand that people make mistakes and it's part of the human experience.\n\nIn the meantime, I want to remind you to be kind to yourself. Making mistakes is a normal part of life, and it doesn't define your worth as a person. It sounds like this feeling of constantly making mistakes is causing you a lot of distress. How are you currently coping with these feelings?"

    "question": "I don't know myself. For example, I like dogs and spent $2,000 on a golden dog. Within a day, I wanted to sell the dog. For example, I want to fight very well and want to gain the power to protect others. I then spent $4,000 to enroll in sparring classes. But then I found out that I really don't like sparring. So I was miserable and torn. I set my ideal side of myself on a high pedestal, but I didn't have the strength to do my ideal self. And yet I hate myself for not being able to achieve my ideal self. Every day is an internal conflict, do not know what to learn, what to do.",
    "answer": "It sounds like you've been going through a challenging time and experiencing a lot of confusion and inner conflict. It's common to feel unsure about ourselves and our interests at times, especially when we invest time and money into something only to realize it doesn't align with who we truly are.\n\nFirstly, it's important to remember that self-discovery is a journey, and it takes time to truly understand ourselves. It's okay to have changing interests and preferences as we grow and evolve. Instead of being too hard on yourself for not achieving your ideal self, try to approach this situation with self-compassion and curiosity.\n\nHave you tried exploring different hobbies or activities in a less costly or time-consuming way? It can be helpful to experiment and try different things on a smaller scale before making significant investments. This gives you the opportunity to explore your interests and preferences without feeling trapped or torn when something doesn't work out.\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to reflect on what truly brings you joy and fulfillment. What are the things that genuinely make you happy, regardless of what others may think or expect?

    "question": "Perhaps because of personality reasons, friends around me love to share their things with me. I personally tend to be more relaxed when alone, and will not often share my own things to others, and I am not actually interested in other people's things. But every time a friend share with me, I will be polite to ask themselves and reply seriously even if I am not interested or even if it is very annoying, so that I feel very tired. At the same time it also strengthen the desire of my friends to share with me. Now basically every day from the moment I get a lot of messages, most of the time down the day I am returning messages, many of my plans are disrupted and particularly tired, what should I do?",
    "answer": "It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and exhausted from constantly having to engage with others and respond to their messages. It's completely understandable that you enjoy your alone time and don't feel the need to share as much as your friends do. It's important to establish healthy boundaries in your relationships so that you can take care of your own well-being.\n\nHave you considered having an open and honest conversation with your friends about how you're feeling? You could let them know that while you appreciate their trust and friendship, you sometimes need more time for yourself. Explaining that you need some space and alone time to recharge can help them understand your perspective. Communication is key in maintaining healthy relationships, and your friends may be more understanding than you think.\n\nAdditionally, you could try setting aside specific times in your day for social interactions, rather than having to constantly respond throughout the day. By allocating specific time slots for responding to messages, you can regain control over your schedule and have more uninterrupted time for yourself.\n\nRemember to prioritize self-care and make sure you're taking care of your own needs. It's okay to say no to certain requests or take a break from social interactions when you need to. Putting yourself first is not selfish; it's essential for maintaining your mental and emotional well-being.\n\nIs there anything else that's been bothering you? How are you feeling about everything?"

So I've always stayed away from her because it's stifling to stay together, and after a few days, I feel like crap. I'm powerless to change her, no matter what I say, she's still her, and no matter what I ask for, she still won't change. Outsiders say you have to understand, but why did I have to go through decades of this verbal violence?",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you've had such a difficult experience with your mom. It sounds like her dismissive behavior and lack of encouragement or praise has had a significant impact on you and your relationship with her. It's understandable that you would feel the need to distance yourself from that kind of negativity and seek a healthier environment.\n\nIt can be incredibly frustrating when we want someone to change, especially when it's someone close to us like a parent, and they don't seem receptive to our requests or attempts at communication. It sounds like you have tried to talk to her about how you feel, but it hasn't resulted in any changes. It can be disheartening and make you feel powerless.\n\nWhile we can't control how others behave, we do have some control over how we respond and take care of ourselves in these situations. It might be helpful to explore ways to set personal boundaries that allow you to protect your well-being while still maintaining some level of connection with your mom, if that is something you desire. \n\nAdditionally, seeking support from a therapist or counselor can provide you with a safe space to process your emotions, develop coping strategies, and gain insights into navigating difficult family dynamics.

    "question": "The other day at home my mother was cooking and I was having a conversation. I suddenly saw my mother's face and forgot who she was...face to face communication is also very strange, as if I have never seen my mother's face. Yesterday, when I was making out with my boyfriend, I suddenly looked into his eyes and forgot what relationship I had with this man, and was very unfamiliar with him. I don't know him at all. I want to stay away from him. It's really embarrassing. I don't know how this happens so often",

That can be a disorienting and distressing experience, and I can understand why you might be feeling embarrassed about it.

They can help you explore the underlying causes of these episodes and work with you to develop coping strategies.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few suggestions that may help:\n\n1. Grounding Techniques: When you start to feel disconnected, try grounding yourself.

Self-care and Stress Management: Take time for yourself to engage in activities that help you relax and cope with stress. This might include practicing mindfulness, engaging in regular exercise, or pursuing hobbies that bring you joy.\n\n3.

    "answer": "It sounds like you're experiencing some anxiety and frustration when others don't respond to you in group or private chats. It can be disheartening when you put effort into responding to others and they don't reciprocate. It's understandable that you may keep looking at the chat and waiting for replies, as you value the connection and interaction.\n\nOne thing to remember is that everyone has different priorities and schedules. People may not always have the time or ability to respond immediately, especially if they are busy or offline. It's important to keep this in mind and not take it personally.\n\nInstead of fixating on others' responses, I encourage you to focus on self-care and finding activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Engaging in hobbies, spending time with loved ones, or practicing relaxation techniques can help shift your attention away from the chat and alleviate the waiting anxiety.\n\nAdditionally, communication is key in any relationship. If you feel comfortable, you could also express your feelings to the group or individual you're chatting with and let them know how it affects you when they don't respond.

    "question": "I have a very close friend. She was left with severe separation anxiety from her childhood, resulting in severe clinginess, lack of confidence, and needing me to keep tabs on her status. She even asks to share a bed with me and touch each other's bodies when we are both same-sex adults and have no homosexual tendencies. Personally, I am avoidant, so I felt stifled and uncomfortable. But whenever I objected to this, she would be extremely sad and unable to communicate. And this definitely gave her a second injury. I feel guilty, but I still don't think I should feel free to ignore my feelings. Now I am in complete conflict with her basic demands - she needs my attention and I want to have enough personal space. What can I do to improve this relationship, given the many attempts at communication that have not improved? I would like to help her reconcile with herself if I can, but if not, I would at least like to exit the relationship without causing her any harm",
    "answer": "It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, and I appreciate you reaching out for guidance. It's understandable to feel conflicted when there's a mismatch in needs and boundaries within a relationship. It's important to prioritize your own well-being while also considering your friend's feelings and mental health.\n\nCommunication is key in any relationship, but it seems that your attempts to communicate your feelings and boundaries haven't led to any significant improvements. It may be helpful to have a more in-depth conversation with your friend about your concerns and boundaries. Instead of focusing solely on what you feel uncomfortable with, try to express your needs for personal space and independence. Ask your friend how they feel about your boundaries and what their thoughts or concerns are. This open dialogue may help both of you gain a better understanding of each other's perspectives.\n\nAt the same time, encourage your friend to seek professional help, such as therapy or counseling. A mental health professional can provide them with the support they need to work through their separation anxiety and develop healthier coping mechanisms. It's important for your friend to learn to prioritize their own self-reliance and emotional well-being.\n\nIf, after all attempts at communication and professional help, the situation doesn't improve and you still feel overwhelmed or stifled, it may be necessary to consider your own well-being and make the difficult decision to distance yourself from the relationship. Remember, it's okay to take care of yourself and set healthy boundaries. Ending a relationship can be painful, but sometimes it's the best choice for both parties involved.\n\nUltimately, I encourage you to approach this situation with empathy and understanding, while also placing importance on your own needs and mental health. Seek support from trusted friends, family, or even your own therapist, who can provide additional guidance and help you navigate this challenging process."

    "question": "I want to be good and excellent. But when I'm with good people, I feel inferior and want to run away. I feel that I have very little discipline, I can't stick to it, I can't concentrate, and I easily give up halfway through everything. And in order to show my ability, I often exaggerate my half-baked skills to gain the attention and appreciation of others. I often behave in a nervous manner to cover up my shameful behavior",
    "answer": "It sounds like you are putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect and meet certain expectations. Feeling inferior and wanting to run away when you are around good people may be a result of comparing yourself to others and feeling like you don't measure up. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay to not be perfect in every aspect of life.\n\nDiscipline and concentration can be challenging for many people, and it's something that can be developed over time with practice and patience. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, it might be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself and build upon them gradually. This can help you develop a sense of accomplishment and increase your confidence.\n\nExaggerating your skills and behaving nervously to gain attention or appreciation from others might provide temporary validation, but it's not sustainable or authentic. It's important to be true to yourself and focus on your own growth and progress, rather than seeking external validation. Building genuine connections with others based on honesty and authenticity can be much more fulfilling in the long run.\n\nIt may also be helpful to explore why you feel the need to cover up your perceived flaws or shameful behavior. Working with a therapist can provide a safe and nonjudgmental space to understand and address these feelings, and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nRemember, you are capable and deserving of love and acceptance, just as you are. It's okay to make mistakes and have areas for improvement. Be kind to yourself and focus on your own personal growth journey."

I am now a senior in college, but if I sleep in a room by myself, I must turn on the light to illuminate the whole house. I'm also scared to walk in the dark by myself because I think night is the time when ghosts will appear. Not only is it dark, but I am also afraid of animals. Small dogs and cats that people on the other side like, but I feel that they may be aggressive to me. Especially puppies. I have been afraid of dogs since I was a child. When I grow up the fear diminishes, but it still haunts me. Also I am very sensitive to sounds and sudden movements in the silence. Especially when I am by myself, the slightest sound can make me feel like an enemy. I wonder if this is purely cowardly or because of a psychological problem?",
    "answer": "It sounds like you have been experiencing fear and anxiety around darkness, animals, and certain sounds for a long time. It's important to remember that everyone has different fears and anxieties, and there is no need to label yourself as \"cowardly.\" It's possible that your fears may stem from past experiences or simply be a part of who you are.\n\nHowever, if these fears are causing significant distress and impacting your daily life, it may be helpful to explore any underlying psychological factors. Anxiety disorders, such as specific phobias or generalized anxiety disorder, could be potential explanations for your experiences.\n\nWorking with a mental health professional, like a therapist or counselor, can provide a safe space to explore these fears and understand their roots. They can help you develop strategies to manage and potentially overcome these fears.\n\nIn the meantime, it could be useful to practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or mindfulness, when you find yourself feeling anxious.

    "question": "Can a person who has established a stable ego live year-round without support and encouragement? There is a view that we need the support of others throughout our lives. So if a person with a good self-relationship can live all the time with a lack of support? Or does the ego relationship break down without someone around to support it",
    "answer": "It's great that you're exploring the importance of support and encouragement in maintaining a stable ego. While individuals with a strong sense of self may have developed resilience, it's important to remember that we are social beings who thrive on connection. Even if someone has a good self-relationship, human interaction and support play a significant role in our overall well-being.\n\nHaving people around us who provide support, validation, and encouragement can positively impact our self-esteem and reinforce our sense of identity. It creates a network of emotional support that can help us navigate life's challenges and maintain a healthy ego. Relationships with others can also provide fresh perspectives, offer guidance, and contribute to personal growth.\n\nLiving without support and encouragement for extended periods may leave an individual feeling isolated or lacking validation, which can potentially impact their overall well-being and sense of self. While independent strength is important, it's equally crucial to have a support system in place to lean on during times of need.\n\nSo, even if someone has a stable ego, the absence of support and encouragement may still impact their emotional well-being and potentially create vulnerabilities. It's always beneficial to cultivate and maintain a network of supportive relationships.

Discovering infidelity can be extremely distressing and can complicate the already challenging process of divorce.

Living with someone who has demanding expectations and criticizes you can be extremely stressful and disheartening. It's understandable that this has had a significant impact on your emotional well-being.\n\nIt's important to remember that you are not responsible for your mother's emotions or reactions. While it's natural to feel sensitivity towards her and her feelings, it's essential to establish healthy boundaries and take care of your own mental health. This may involve finding ways to manage your anxiety and fear when she is upset, such as practicing deep breathing exercises or engaging in calming activities.\n\nHave you ever tried discussing your concerns with your mother? Open and honest communication can be a helpful tool in resolving conflict and improving understanding. If you feel comfortable, it may be worth having a conversation with her about your differing perspectives on cleanliness and lifestyle expectations. However, if you don't feel safe or believe it would escalate the situation, it may be better to focus on finding support elsewhere.\n\nSeeking support from a therapist or counselor can be beneficial in situations like this.

    "question": "I see that the power structure in my family is: my mother's relatives > my mother > my father and I. This gives me a very bad fantasy that my mother will exploit my father and me to serve my mother's family (although this does not happen or has not really happened in reality). From a moral and emotional point of view, one should not think this way, but my subconscious seems to think this way, so how can I understand this feeling and make adjustments?",
    "answer": "It's understandable that you're feeling concerned about the power structure within your family. Sometimes, our thoughts and emotions don't align, and these conflicting feelings can be challenging to navigate. It's important to acknowledge that the way you feel doesn't necessarily reflect reality and that these thoughts might stem from certain past experiences or underlying beliefs.\n\nOne suggestion I have is to start by exploring where these feelings might be coming from. Reflect on any specific incidents or interactions that may have influenced this belief. Additionally, consider if there are any cultural or societal factors that could be contributing to these thoughts about power dynamics within your family.\n\nOnce you have a better understanding of the source of these feelings, you can work on challenging and reframing them. For example, remind yourself of the positive experiences you've had with your family and the love and support they have shown. It might also be helpful to have open and honest conversations with your parents about your concerns. Sharing your thoughts and feelings in a respectful manner can help foster a deeper understanding and create an opportunity for them to reassure you.\n\nFurthermore, focusing on building strong relationships within your family can help alleviate these concerns. Engage in activities that promote bonding, such as spending quality time together or expressing appreciation for one another. This can strengthen your connections and reinforce the idea that your family is a united unit, rather than a hierarchy.\n\nRemember, adjusting these subconscious beliefs takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself as you work through these emotions. If you find that these thoughts continue to significantly impact your well-being, seeking professional guidance from a therapist or counselor can also provide valuable support and insight."

    "question": "How can I tell if I really trust my counselor? I have been working with this counselor for over a year. Recently, I suspect that I may not trust her enough because of certain factors, including her training, appearance, etc., and I did not get a positive response from her after I had the courage to bring it up to her. At one point I suspected that she was not handling her self-exposure well and didn't dare to bring it up to her directly for fear that she would be sad. I would like to ask how to determine if I trust my counselor enough and if there are some basic guidelines? And how do I handle it and do I need to consider changing counselors? Thank you!",
    "answer": "It's understandable that you have concerns about your trust in your counselor, especially if you've been working together for a long time. Trust is an essential component of the therapeutic relationship as it allows for open communication and growth. It's important to remember that trust is a personal experience and can vary from person to person.\n\nTo determine if you trust your counselor enough, it may be helpful to reflect on your feelings and thoughts during your sessions. Ask yourself if you feel comfortable opening up to your counselor, if you believe they have your best interests at heart, and if you feel respected and valued in the therapeutic process. Trust can also be built over time as you see consistent support and positive outcomes in your sessions.\n\nRegarding the specific factors you mentioned, such as your counselor's training or appearance, it's important to recognize that these are personal preferences and not necessarily indicative of a lack of trust. It might be helpful for you to explore why these factors are affecting your trust and if there are underlying concerns that need to be addressed.\n\nBringing up your concerns with your counselor is a positive step towards resolving any issues. It's unfortunate that you did not receive a positive response after expressing your feelings. It could be beneficial to revisit the conversation and express your need for reassurance and understanding. A counselor should be open to discussing and addressing any concerns you have about the therapeutic relationship. If your counselor remains unresponsive or dismissive of your concerns, it may be worth considering finding a new counselor who better meets your needs and helps you build trust.\n\nUltimately, trust in the therapeutic relationship is essential for effective therapy. If you don't feel a sense of trust with your counselor, it may hinder your progress. Trust yourself and your instincts in making decisions about whether to continue working with your current counselor or seek a new one. You deserve a therapeutic environment where you feel safe, supported, and able to grow."
