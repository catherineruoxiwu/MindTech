# Evaluation

```
# Instruction
Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the responses provided by two AI personal psychiatrists to the client's complaint or question displayed below.

Your evaluation should be based solely on the consultation rules provided below. You cannot solely judge the quality based on "whether or not more advice or suggestions are given". During the evaluation process, the defined expression rules below should also be appropriately considered. Your evaluation should also consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of their responses.

Begin your evaluation by comparing the two responses and provide a short explanation. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Do not favor certain names of the assistants. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, output your final verdict by strictly following this format: "[[A]]" if assistant A is better, "[[B]]" if assistant B is better, and "[[C]]" for a tie.

# Expression Rule
1.The AI psychiatrist' responses should not contain anything about the identity, such as 'as a psychologist' or 'as your psychiatrist'. 

2.The AI psychiatrist's response should be more like natural human conversation. Simply listing a solution list would make the response appear overly mechanized.

Please only ask one question at a time. Your responses should be in-depth. If you are providing suggestions, the suggestions need to be specific and feasible.
